Billionaire and onetime top White House advisor Elon Musk said he was invited to a tech leader summit at the White House’s newly renovated Rose Garden on Thursday, but will not be attending.
“I was invited, but unfortunately could not attend. A representative of mine will be there,” Musk said on Thursday, replying to an X user who asked why the xAI, SpaceX and Tesla leader was not invited.
The guest list for Thursday’s event includes Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, according to a White House official.
The fact that Musk was invited could be a sign that the relationship between Musk and the White House is thawing. Once referred to as “the first buddy,” and near constant presence at President Donald Trump’s side, Musk had a messy blowup with the president this summer after leaving his position at the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk even vowed to support primary challengers of Republicans who voted for Trump’s signature funding bill, and he claimed he would be starting a new political party, although there does not seem to have been any movement on that front.
